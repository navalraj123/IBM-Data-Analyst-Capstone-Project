# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project

In this course provided by IBM, I will assume the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets. The capstone project will culminate with a presentation of your data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization. I believe this project is a great opportunity to showcase Data Analytics skills, and demonstrate proficiency to potential employers. 

The following are the modules performed during this project.

Data Collection
Collecting Data Using Webscraping
Exploring Data
Data Wrangling
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Dashboard Creation
Presentation of Findings
